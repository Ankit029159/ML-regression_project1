# Lung Capacity Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Summary

This project uses **Machine Learning** to build a model that predicts **Lung Capacity** based on demographic and health data.

The model is trained using the **Linear Regression** algorithm and evaluated using standard regression metrics.

---

## Dataset

The dataset file used in this project is:

It contains features such as:

- Age  
- Height  
- Gender  
- Smoking status  
- Lung Capacity (target)

---

## Objective

Build and evaluate a **Linear Regression model** that predicts lung capacity values using relevant input features.

---

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following Python libraries:

These libraries are used for:

- Data manipulation (pandas, numpy)  
- Visualization and EDA (matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Model building and evaluation (scikit-learn)

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

4. Run the notebook:

---

## Model Evaluation

The Linear Regression model is evaluated using:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  

Lower RMSE indicates better prediction accuracy.

---

## Results & Insights

- Visualized relationships between features and target  
- Handled missing values  
- Built and trained the model  
- Evaluated performance using appropriate metrics

(You can add visual plots or final values here if desired.)

## Future Work

- Compare with other regression models (Ridge, Lasso)  
- Attempt polynomial regression  
- Test advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Convert to a web app using Flask/Streamlit
